Just a web dood playin around with [roots](http://roots.cx/). Makin a site for touch devices with hammer.js, nothin too crazy. I'm hoping for a mostly thumb driven experience, while this app works on desktop, it's very mobile first. Notice the lack of frameworks, mobile needs like nothing to exists to be fast. I'm building with a very minimal set that can give me liquid gesture driven touch.

I'll be using this place as a gesture and touch playground. Also, as a by product and need of content, my blog.
