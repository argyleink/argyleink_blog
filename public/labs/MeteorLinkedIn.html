Many of my personal experiments needed a small dataset to playwith, and Ratio&#39;s employee list has always been there for me. But after the company grew, I didn&#39;t want to manually add these fools everytime. So with the power of Meteor and the LinkedIn API, new employee&#39;s just need to visit my Meteor app, click connect with LinkedIn, and they&#39;re done. No more updating info, no more adding profile photos or adding emails, it&#39;s all there. </p>
<p>So I got to play with the LinkedIn API and Meteor&#39;s live UI framework. Fun stuff, for a nerd.</p>
