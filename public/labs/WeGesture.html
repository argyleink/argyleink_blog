        <h1>WeGesture</h1><p>Gestures were just catching on when I made this prototype. I felt it was unfair for designer and developers at Apple or any company
to decide how people would gesture for an action on a device. I hope that these companies did something similar to this prototype.</p>
<p>This prototype asks users to gesture for a given set of common actions: forward, backward, copy, paste, play, pause, etc. After users
gesture for the action, an image is saved of their gesture. That&#39;s it, that&#39;s all I needed from the users, just their idea.</p>
<p>Once I had enough images saved on my server, I made a <a href="http://argyleink.com/weGesture/results.html">microsite</a> to showcase everyone&#39;s 
gesture choices! The findings were pretty crazy. </p>
