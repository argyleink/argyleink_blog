    <h1>Social Logik</h1><p>An early prototype of mine, intended to help people who struggle making small talk. This app provides the user with topics, jokes,
and don&#39;ts for the type of person they are talking to. Here&#39;s an easy example: Jock needs to talk to a nerdy chick, or the other way
around. Simple, open the app, find the male jock, and start paroozing crowd sourced topics, jokes and dont&#39;s that a jock will
likely find amusing or entertaining.</p>
<p>My design isn&#39;t that great, now that I look back, but the idea is there and the prototype execution certainly helps get the idea across.</p>
